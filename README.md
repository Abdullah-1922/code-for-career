# Daily C Coding Practice

Welcome to my daily  coding practice repository! ðŸš€

## Overview
This repository contains my daily exercises and practice problems focused on mastering the C programming language. Each file is named according to the date and problem number to help track my progress and keep my learning organized.

## Repository Structure
- **`build/Debug/`**: Directory containing build files and executables for debugging purposes.
- **`*.c`**: C source files for daily practice, named according to the date and problem number (e.g., `d4m11y2024n1.c` for the first exercise of 04/11/2024 ).
- **`*.exe`**: Executable files generated from the corresponding C source files.
- **`README.md`**: Overview and structure of this repository.

## Purpose
This repository will be updated daily with new C programs and exercises to showcase my progress and learning journey. The main objectives include:
- Strengthening my understanding of C programming concepts.
- Applying theoretical knowledge through practical examples.
- Building a collection of solved problems and example codes for future reference.

## How to Use
1. Navigate to the code file you wish to view or run.
2. Clone this repository and compile the code using `gcc` or any preferred C compiler:
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o filename
   ./filename
Executable files (.exe) can be directly run if you're on Windows.
Stay Tuned!
- I will be adding new  code daily to enhance my coding skills. Feel free to explore, learn, and even share feedback!
